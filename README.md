## Key Features

### Hybrid Model: Attention U-Net + Conditional GANs
Our approach combines the spatial feature extraction of **Attention U-Net** with the generative capabilities of **Conditional GANs**, allowing us to:
- Focus on essential spatial features in SAR images.
- Generate realistic and context-aware colors.
  
### Overcoming Challenges:
- **Speckle Noise Reduction**: SAR images are inherently noisy, and we mitigate this using advanced preprocessing.
- **Accurate Feature Extraction**: Attention U-Net helps retain spatial and contextual details.
- **Realistic Colorization**: cGANs generate visually compelling and accurate colors.

2. **Model Architecture**:
    - **Attention U-Net**: Focuses on spatial features, preserving important details.
    - **Conditional GANs**: Generates realistic colorization based on input grayscale images.
3. **Post-processing**: Colorized outputs are evaluated for quality.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: 29.29 dB
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**: 0.83
- **Average Processing Time**: 1.44 seconds per image
